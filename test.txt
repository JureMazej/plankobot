Praying with others across the world
Lord, you said that when two or three
 would gather together in your name,
 then you would be present with them.
I am praying by myself (or ‘on the Internet’)
 but I am uniting myself
 with many individual Christians
 throughout the world
 who, though separate,
 are gathered together in another sense
 to pray to you,
 and I trust that you are with me now.

When the thought of you wakens in us
God our heavenly Father,
 when the thought of you
 wakes in our hearts,
 let its awakening
 not be like a startled bird
 that flies about in fear.
Instead, let it be like a child
 waking from sleep
 with a heavenly smile. (Søren Kierkegaard)

Christ our Morning Star
O Christ, our Morning Star,
Splendour of Light Eternal,
shining with the glory of the rainbow,
come and waken us
from the greyness of our apathy,
and renew in us your gift of hope. Amen. (Bede the Venerable)

Come, Holy Spirit
Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful,
and enkindle in them the fire of your love.
Send forth your Spirit and they shall be created
And you shall renew the face of the earth.
O God, who has taught the hearts of the faithful
by the light of the Holy Spirit,
grant that by the gift of the same Spirit
we may be always truly wise
and ever rejoice in his consolation.
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

At the rising of your sun
Lord God, Creator of light,
at the rising of your sun each morning,
let the greatest of all lights - your love -
rise, like the sun, within my heart.
